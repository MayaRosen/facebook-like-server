# Workflow
- At first we opened a JIRA project and split the assignments between then two of us.
- Because some parts of the project depend on each other we worked together to decide exactly what we have to do so we don't work twice.
- After we both finished our parts we combined them together and ran many tests to make sure it all works well.
- We hope you enjoy the hard work we put into this project.
